Between versions 1 and 2, I preferred version 2. The full comp seemed better balanced with the texture and color scheme I picked out for it. I liked the textures of the wood, sky, and marble with the darker, more neutral color scheme and overall layout. I got a very good idea of the comp layout with both style tiles just by looking at them. The layout is very simple, and was very easy to picture. I spent a little over an hour making the style tiles, comparing them, and deciding which one, version 2, I wanted to use for my website.
