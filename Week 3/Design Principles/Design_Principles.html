    <h1>Design Principles in the Wild</h1>
    <h3>Holly Osmer - MI 349</h3>

    <h2>1. Affordance</h2>
    <img src="Affordance.png" width=800 height=220>
    <p>This screenshot contains an example of affordance. Affordances are the physical characteristics that
      influence the functionality of an object. The 3D button that says "Tweet" with a quill next to it,
      gives the impressing that when someone is ready to post what they have just typed out, they should
      "press" that button and it will send the tweet out.</p>

    <h2>2. Mapping</h2>
    <img src="Mapping.png" width=800 height=500>
    <p> This is an example of mapping, from Google Maps. The layout is extremely easy to navigate.
        The symbols area easy to interpret and very well place. That goes for the bottom as well. If
        the user were to want ot find their location, view satelite view, etc, the bottom corners are
        always the first place to look. Their visible, but not in the way.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Chunking</h2>
    <img src="Chunking.png" width=800 height=500>
    <p> This is an example of chunking, from Buzzfeed. Chunking is the combining of information into a limited
      amount of chunks for easier processing and recall. The layout of this landing page on Buzfeed is very well layed
      out. The basic information of each article is well-summed up through the headlines and few follow-up sentances.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>
    <img src="SignalToNoise.png" width=800 height=450>
    <p> Signal-to-Noise ratio is the ratio of relevant to irrelevant information in a display. This
      landing page is a good example to good signal-to-noise ratio because everything is very straightforward and
      easy to comprehend at first glance.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Hick's Law</h2>
    <img src="HicksLaw.png" width=800 height=500>
    <p> Hick's Law explains the time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of alternatives increases.
      The layout of Apple's home page is so simple, and once again straightforward, most users come to the sight already
      knowing what they want, or not taking any time at all figuring it out. The navigation options are simple and
      the design is not overwhelimg.
